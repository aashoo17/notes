babel-loader => using cacheDirectory to load from cache
loader: 'babel-loader?cacheDirectory'
loader: babel-loader?cacheDirectory=true	//default cache directory will be used

cacheDirectory=true uses cached content by babel and will not recompile every time
default cache directory is node_modules/.cache
