```c
int x = 3;
//basic if syntax
//so == and others <= => will give 0 or 1 can be thought of false and true respectively
if(x == 3){

}else if(x == 4){

}else{

}
```

so basic building block of if and else is conditional operators which gives truth and false  <,>,<=,>=

## truth and false in c

for numbers = 0 is false anything else is true  
for pointers = NULL (0) pointer is false others true  
for chars = '\0' is false others true  

### if we say if(6) what if is evaluating will the if block will run or not
this will run as 6 will become true

### if(x = 3) is an assignment inside if will it run the if block  
it will run as expression x = 3 will assign x value of 3 and this is expression which evaluates to 3 which in turn is true  


### if(x != 0) vs if(x) syntax
both are eventually same 
x != 0 says x should not be zero to be true
x says true if non zero
