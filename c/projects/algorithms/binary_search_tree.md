recursive data type to implement a node   
tree will be collection of nodes  

all the data related to tree/node will be heap allocated so it will persist till program is running and functions are used to manipulate the tree

idea of insertion   
recursive functions are used to look for space to attach the new node

deletion  
deletion is similar to insert except if the root has to be deleted some child has to be promoted 

find a value  
using recursion  

getmax  
get the max value  



recursive struct using pointers  
constructor in c  
recursion  
pointer which can/will be null and manipulating it inside a function ??  
event loop idea
