# loop

IAR - instruction address register  
keeps next instruction to be executed  
changes serially one to next instruction automatically  
what if we can change this at our will  
processor gives opcode to do this  
loop - say start at instruction at line 10 go till instruction 15 and jump to 10 again and so on... you got a loop
