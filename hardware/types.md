# types or variables

1. operations like +, - , *, /  etc.. supported by ALU on binary integers and floats  
2. storage of these variables - store them anywhere in RAM  
stack and heap are common way to store in memory  
3. char, bool, string are not supported they are ideas built on top of integer numbers  
char - ascii, unicode encoding on top of integers  
string - array of chars  
bool - just integers with new type name  
4. pointer - address in RAM is generally hidden by compiler from normal user, pointer exposes that address to store and work on them
