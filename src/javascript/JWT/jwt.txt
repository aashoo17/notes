JsonWebToken

Nothing but a simple json object
This object will be send to client generally after their authentication by username/password, google,facebook
then this object will be sent to server during api calls since this object is send by server initially it will 
know if it is correct or not by decoding it

jsonwebtoken is node module for implementing JWT in node.js servers

npm i -S jsonwebtoken		//install
using postman software to make api calls for interactive results

how JWT works

jwt consists of three parts 
1. header
2. payload
3. signature

header will have information about type of algorithm for encoding data, specifying object is a JWT etc
e.g.
{
    "typ": "JWT",
    "alg": "HS256"
} 

payload could be any object to be send generally some unique key pair values are sent about the user
var payload = {
	id: 1,
	name: 'Ashutosh Singh',
	age: 25
}

signature
//TODO: what is base64url encoding
encode header and payload with base64url and attach with . then hash it with mentioned algorithm with secret
as per your wish

data = base64urlEncode( header ) + “.” + base64urlEncode( payload )
signature = Hash( data, secret );

// header
eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9
// payload
eyJ1c2VySWQiOiJiMDhmODZhZi0zNWRhLTQ4ZjItOGZhYi1jZWYzOTA0NjYwYmQifQ
// signature
-xN_h82PHVTCMA9vdoHrcZxH-x5mb11y1537t3rGzcM

put all of them together with dot JWT is ready
// JWT Token
eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOiJiMDhmODZhZi0zNWRhLTQ4ZjItOGZhYi1jZWYzOTA0NjYwYmQifQ.-xN_h82PHVTCMA9vdoHrcZxH-x5mb11y1537t3rGzcM

note: so server or anyone can easily know the header and payload by decoding it with base64url
but can't decode the signature without correct secret key

store this JWT in local storage to send with api calls 
server will try to use header with payload to get a signature by using its known secret key 
if signature matches auth success else you can forbid the route
