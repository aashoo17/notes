# Set Theory

set - a collection of any objects may be all are same or may be not  

A = {10,20,30,40,50}   all are same type  
B = {10,"Hello",'c',20}    not all are same  

usually in programming we deal with same type though  

N = {0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}, the set of natural numbers    
Z = {. . . , −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, . . .}, the set of integers    
Z+ = {1, 2, 3, . . .}, the set of positive integers  
Q = {p/q | p ∈ Z, q ∈ Z, and q = 0}, the set of rational numbers  
R, the set of real numbers   
R+ , the set of positive real numbers   
C, the set of complex numbers.  

**equality of sets**  

**empty set**  

**singleton set**  

**venn diagrams**  

**subset**  

**size of a set**  

**power set**  

## set operations  
union  
intersection  
difference  
complement  


## computer representation of sets
so we generally need to do this   

ordering of set in some order  
make searching faster  

hashset and btreemap set are best candidates

## set functions

## sequences

fibonacci sequence  
arithmetic progression  
geometric sequence 

## summation 
some of some common sequences  


## matrices
summation/substraction  
multiplication
