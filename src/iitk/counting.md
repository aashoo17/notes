# Counting

**the product rule**   
task 1 = M ways to so  
task 2 = N ways to do  
both task 1 and task 2 = M x N  

**the sum rule**   
task 1 = M to do it  
and   
task 1 = Another N way to do it  
total ways for task 1 then = M + N way  

**the difference rule**    
task 1 = M to do it  
and   
task 1 itself = another N way to do it  
but M and N say have common wasy as M ∩ N   
total ways for task 1 then = M + N - M ∩ N way  

**the divison rule**  

TODO: find out working

**permutation**  
filling r places with n values is called nPr - here all orders matter  

**combination**  
filling r places with n values is called nCr - here no ordering matter  


## Divide and conquer algorithm  
**binary search**  

**merge sort**
