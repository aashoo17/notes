Low level languages
1. machine language => written code in binary 0 and 1 
(also written in hex)

hard to write, understand and debug
2. assembly language => some specific binary code is given names in english 
like START, END etc ,still they are still hardware specific

High level languages
They are written in plain english and by using appropriate translator can be converted 
for any type of hardware so they are machine independent. But translator will take time
to convert and generated code may be inefficient than written directly in machine language

compiled languages 
they are converted to machine code totally and then executed
//TODO: object code

interpreted language
they are converted to machine code line by line and keep on executing

any language can be implemented as compiled or interpreted

scripting language
job is to combine different programs to automate the job
program which in itself do the some task
