# IP Protocol

## IP Header

**IP header field**   
header + header options field  
by seeing header only how can we transfer data  
1. local delivery (on same network)  
2. forwarding (on other network)  


**packet fragmentation/defragmentation**  
why ip needs to do it ? why not keep this option with lower level protocols like tcp/udp etc  

**ip checksums**  
effectiveness of ip checksums  
why only header were considered to get the checksum and data not included  

## data structures and functions used in linux to achieve all the things IP was supposed to

## IP forwarding and local delivery
how linux does that

## transmission of data

## handling fragmentation

## Raw IP handling

## ICMP message protocol for routers

## neighbour system

## routing protocols
