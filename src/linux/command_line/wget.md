# WGET

**download from a link**  
wget https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts   

by default wget tries to download things and keep it stored in a file  
making it send output/response on stdout  
wget -O- https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts  

**Continue an Incomplete Download**  
wget -c file

**Mirror an Entire Website**  
wget -m http://example.com

**Download an Entire Directory**  
wget -r ftp://example.com/folder

**Download a List of Files at Once**  

If you canâ€™t find an entire folder of the downloads you want, wget can still help. 
Just put all of the download URLs into a single TXT file.
then point wget to that document with the -i option. Like this:
wget -i download.txt
