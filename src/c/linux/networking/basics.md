# Internet
[how internet works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/How_does_the_Internet_work)  

e.g. 1 - how cell phone talks to networks  
server(computer) --> optical fiber line --> connected to cell tower --> tower throws electromaagnetic waves --> captured by cell phone antennas  

e.g.2 - working through modem  
server(computer) --> optical fiber line --> connected to phone line --> modem (required to convert electrical signal to something phone line can understand) --> modem connected to computer

e.g. 3 - multiple computers connected to routers  
server(computer) --> optical fiber line --> connected to routers --> multiple (or one) computer connected to router  

## ways which data (streams of 0 and 1 can be transferred)
- over electrical line using high voltage for 1 and low volatege for 0
- optical fibre  
[how optical fibre transmit 0 and 1 ](https://networkengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/22676/is-fiber-optic-digital-or-analog-optical-signal-is-digital-or-analog)  
- by two antennas having transmitter and receiver like in staellites  

# TCP/UDP protocol  


# IP protocol

# Neighbouring protocol
[video explanation of neighbour protocol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3LFt7CHpgs)    

ipv4 - ARP  
ipv6 - NDP (network discovery protocol)  
TODO: NDP should be able to used with ipv4 also I don't find any reason not to
