just see the man page of gdb it has lot of information  
man gdb  

most required thing is as follows  

1. compile program from gcc using -g flag for debug symbols  
2. gdb compiled_program_name
3. b line_no (for putting break point)
4. run (start the execution and block just before 1st breakpoint)
5. print variable_name (to see the variable value)
