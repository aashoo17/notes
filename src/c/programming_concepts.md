Number representation in binary/computer


conversion concept
binary to decimal or vice versa

easy to convert binary to hexadecimal or octal by seeing binary nos
octal take 3 digits from right and fill 0 if any is left without 3

hexadecimal take 4 digits from right and fill 0 if any is left without 4
since binary no will be big and cumbersome generally binary no is represented as hexadecimal.

No can be negative too so left 0 is used for + and 1 is for -
problem arises if you store same no with + and - sign as there will exist one +0 and -0
hence all binary -ve no are 2's complement meaning reverse the bits and add 1.
