# Graph

G = (V,E)  
graph G is => combination of set of vertex V and set of edges E  
**finite graph** => finite edges and finite vertex  
**multigraphs** => two vertex are connected with more than one edge  
**loop** => 1 vertex is connected from edge to itself  
**undirected graph** => no direction    
**directed graph** => direction is available in edges
