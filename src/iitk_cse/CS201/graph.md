# Graph

**G = (V,E)** - graph G is combination of set of vertex V and set of edges E  
**finite graph** - finite edges and finite vertex  
**simple graphs** - A graph in which each edge connects two different vertices and where
no two edges connect the same pair of vertices is called a simple graph  
**multigraphs** - two vertex are connected with more than one edge  
**loop** - 1 vertex is connected from edge to itself  
**undirected graph** - no direction    
**directed graph** - direction is available in edges  

**graph models**  
- web graph  
- module dependency graph
- concurrent processing
- airline routes 
- road networks 
- round robin   
- cycles  
- wheels   
- Interconnection Networks for Parallel Computation
