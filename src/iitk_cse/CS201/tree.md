# Tree
tree is undirected graph with no simple circuit  
undirected - no direction  
no simple circuit - means no loop and no multiple edges from two vertices  

## Rooted tree
give a vertex name root now edge from root can be given direction  

## m-ary trees
if each vertes has m children then it is called m-ary tree


## balanced m-ary tree
subtrees at each vertex contain paths of approximately the same length  
**level**  
level of a vertex v in a rooted tree is the length of the unique path from the root to this vertex  
**height**  
height of a rooted tree is the maximum of the levels of vertices  
In other words, the height of a rooted tree is the length of the longest path from the root to any vertex  

## Binary Search Tree (BST)

## Huffman coding

## Tree traversal
preorder traversal  
inorder traversal  
postorder traversal  

## spanning tree

**spanning tree**  
**minimum spanning tree**  
**prims's algorith**  
**Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm**
