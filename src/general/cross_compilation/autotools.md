why autotools

cross compilation
what are the problems with c that on different system things vary
consider c functions
that do not exist everywhere (e.g., strtod())
that have different names (e.g., strchr() vs. index())
that have varying prototypes
(e.g., int setpgrp(void); vs. int setpgrp(int, int);)
that can behave differently (e.g., malloc(0);)
that might require other libraries
(is pow() in libm.so or in libc.so?)
that can be defined in different headers
(string.h vs. strings.h vs. memory.h)



which are the files written manually for cross compilation

=> configure.ac
=> Makefile.am

how above these files can be used to result in one file => makefile
I mean to say which one is run first or what order to follow etc
autoreconf ??

what is generated by autotools automatically

what is the file invoked by end user to compile
=> configure

what does ./configure produce
=> makefile
