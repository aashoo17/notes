[xml and java relationship in android](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36957636/what-is-the-relationship-between-xml-and-java-in-android)

since xml does not do anything actually seeing the predefined xml tag of views
some piece of code is running which places the things accordingly

using this idea not only layout xml but other xml files are also used to provide initial convenience
strings.xml => store strings 
color.xml => store color values
etc

now since you want to manipulate can use id to get those java classes and manipulate them with your own code

//TODO: don't use any xml create View class from Java and set its different properties are call methods and 
display the view
