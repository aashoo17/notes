**[Learning haskell](https://www.vacationlabs.com/haskell/basic-types-and-functions.html#basic-data-types)**

## types

haskell has list 
why not it is called array
multidimensional list


List has same type of element

## Basic operators
arithmetic, boolean, concatenation etc
boolean not how it is different

## function and recursion

writing a function 
what would be function signature
is  it mandatory to write what are the effects of writing vs not writing

return from function

using recursion withou using any loops
to get the job done

## conditionals
if then else

no truthy and falsy

## lambdas and higher order function

no name function = lambdas 
how it is written a bit different \ use
