# Thread

why thread over process its benefits due to modern cpu  
so many thread apis available using posix  

thread synchronisation => waiting for a thread to complete  
mutex use => lock a part of code to be accessed by one thread only at a time   
mutex deadlock

atomic operation support by cpu  
data races vs race condition

idea of threadpool
